Millennia ago, those small kingdom/herds, or duchies as they become known, swore allegiance to the ancient Empire - ruled by a small collection of Kelpien that were brave and skilled enough to protect the other duchies from predators.

In the millennia since then, as the Federation sunk into decline, seclusion and ennui, things have only complicated further.\n\nThe result today is a system heavy with rituals, customs, bureaucracy and procedure, with every action requiring approval from multiple local community forums and elective regional archons. The leader of the First Federation, the President, has only the powers of a figure head, while the very little actual power is fought over by the various committees.

 pc_protostar_desc:	"Stellar nurseries, often found in the heart of dense star clusters, are highly condensed pockets of interstellar matter that are in the process of forming into new protostars. Those are stars at the final stage of their formation, just before the ignition of the thermonuclear reactions in the nucleus. After the ignition, the outward pressure from the released energy finds an equilibrium with the inward pressure from the gravitational pull of the newly formed star's mass. The protostar then officially becomes a main-sequence star."

 START_SCREEN_AKR:	"Justice. Authority. Security. \n\nThese are the values of our people. These values have guided our civilisation as we joined together under a single unified government, and they have guided us as we reached out into the stars around us. We are firm and unflinching in our support of these values, and none, be they subversive traitors and rabble rousers among our own people, nor those we will surely encounter among the stars themselves, shall shake us from our convictions. \n\nIf it is the will of the authority our Domain pursues, than it is just. Those who defy that will are defying authority, threatening security, and creating injustice. \n\nDo not waver, for we are in the right."
 START_SCREEN_AmaralanDomain:	"Work brings us Purpose, provides us with our bounty. Work keeps us from Idleness and Sloth, and keeps the time of Eternal Sleep at bay. \n\nWork has brought us Progress. It has brought us Prosperity. It has given us Peace. These things are known to all of us, and are as much fact as the light that we see, the skin of our bodies, the warmth within us all that gives us life. \n\nWe must not allow the servants of the Lazy One to lead us astray. There is always more work to be done, more work to keep our hands idle so that we may have Progress, Prosperity, and Peace. And as we take our first steps out into a wider galaxy, one of our most sacred truths is shown to be beyond question even when leaving our home.\n\n§Y'There is never a shortage of Work, for those willing to seek it out.'§! - Amaralan Saying"
 START_SCREEN_AndorianEmpire:	"We have risen from the icy plains of our homeworld millennia ago.\n\nWhile we have become formidable fighters, we also became explorers. The day the icebreaker Kumari returned to port after circumnavigating Andoria is still one of the proudest moments in Andorian history. Kumari remains the most prestigious name for an Imperial Guard vessel to this day.\n\nNow we are ready for a new step forward. The galaxy itself awaits us. Should we find enemies, we shall be ready to fight them. Should we find honourable aliens out there, we shall not hesitate to offer them our friendship.\n\nBut in either case, we shall be ready."
 START_SCREEN_AndorianRebellion:	"We were a proud race, once. Our people strove for excellence - in art, in love, in ushaan. Our artificers made ice sculptuers miles high, our explorer corp members trod on the surfaces of hundreds of planets. Our empire stretched across a dozen light years, and aliens quaked in fear when the Imperial Guard ships visited their system.\nThe pink skins brushed all of this aside in a year. Vain and cruel and dishonourable, they have stolen the weapons of our enemy and turned them against us.\nNow we have no choice but to ally ourselves with those that in their foolishness, have unleashed the human madness on the galaxy. This alliance, this Coalition of Hope will serve... for now. But in time the Vulcans too shall pay."
 START_SCREEN_ANT:	"The pack is strong! Our ability to hunt as one lets us find prey and devour them quickly, offering them the great honour of being our next meal. The nearby Selay are weak, they are cowardly and do not act as a pack should. Their attacks grow tiresome with each passing day.

And our future is one that is shaped by our war with the Denobulans. \n\nThat war has cost us much, but we shall not let it weigh us down. We shall remember it and look to prevent such conflicts in the future, but we shall never forget. As we reach further into the stars and seek to find new worlds for ourselves and encounter others, we shall seek to ensure that we do not see a new conflict bring further scars to our people.\n\nBut if such does occur, we shall remember. And we shall not forget, no matter how much others may think we should. For if we forget, then we cannot ensure the mistakes of the past are not made once more. \n\nAnd one thing we shall never forget... is to never trust a Denobulan. \n\n§Y'Do you believe that saving one Antaran will assuage your guilt for killing millions?'§! - Hudak"
 START_SCREEN_ApergosianHarmony:	"Citizens of our Harmonious Republic! I speak to you now as we arrive on the cusp of a momentous time in our history. As this new year dawns, we have reached into the vacuum of space and secured our home system. We have built ships to expand our influence to the stars beyond, to search out what curiosities may lurk out there. \n\nIt has taken us a long time to reach this point, to develop the means to venture beyond our world and the borders of our system. There were many amongst our us who were not sure if we were making the right decision.\n\nWe have weighed the pros and cons, countless times, and it is my duty to inform you now... \n\nThat we are still not sure if we are making the right choice.\n\nBut know that under my administration's careful guidance and work, we shall indeed figure out whether we shall take this next step forward into the great unknown together. \n\n... That is of course if you decide to keep my administration around. Which I hope you will.

 START_SCREEN_ARG:	"The moment our ancestors introduced law and order to our villages, we ascended from nomadic savages into a true civilisation. For the first time our people planted roots which would form the first communities on our planet.\n\nFrom those humble beginnings our culture grew into a shining beacon of innovation and justice. For generations our justice system was cruel and barbaric, imprisoning criminals away inside prison cells in complexes across the land where they could not repent for their crimes. With the discovery of mind altering techniques everything changed.\n\nImplanting false memories of virtual imprisonment and incarceration inside criminals provides an effective punishment, especially over numerous life sentences. Their minds believe they have been incarcerated for their full sentence, specially adapted to the individual to bring the prisoner back to a law abiding nature. Our civilisation is a shining beacon of law.\n\n§Y'You can't let that brief moment define your entire life. If you do, if you pull that trigger, then the Argrathi will have won - they will have destroyed a good man.'§! - Dr Julian Bashir"
 START_SCREEN_ATE:	"Our oceans teem with life, our numbers swell and our technology expands. Our initial test flights into the great dark ocean above have shown us there is an entire galaxy of worlds where we can spread our spawn too, but only at great cost. The bravest explorers and scientists will endure the harshest conditions in order to spread our spawn across the stars, finding new worlds to call our own.\n\nPerhaps in time we will find other lifeforms in other oceans, though that comes with its own dangers. The great star ocean is dark, and full of terrors."
 START_SCREEN_BajoranRepublic:	"The Bajoran civilisation has flourished for nearly five hundred thousand years. \n\nAccomplished in science, mathematics, philosophy and the arts, the Bajoran people are united in their faith in the Prophets and their reverence of the Orbs they send."
 START_SCREEN_BAN:	"In the eons since the first primitive Banea communities took shape on the windy plains of Banea, our civilisation has spread and prospered. We were driven forward by steady scientific progress, and armed conflicts between nation states became increasingly rare. The framework for a global democratic government was eventually laid, and when the last holdouts voluntarily joined we stood united as a single nation.\n\nNow, after the successful creation of several experimental subspace fields, the finest minds of Banea have finished development of the first warp drives. The stars themselves are finally within our grasp!"
 START_SCREEN_BaulHighCouncil:	"Admirals, Generals, it is time once more to assess the state of our people. We have broken the speed of light and this brings with it great oppurtunities... and great dangers. \n\nAs we have learned from the Kelpiens, there will be races out there that will be a danger to us if we are not careful. \n\nWe must make sure we are ready and able to defend ourselves. To keep those who would interfere in our internal affairs away. \n\nIt is our job to ensure that our species does not cease to exist, as it so nearly did before. If need be we must be ready to act in any way to safeguard ourselves. The stars beckon. Let us make sure we are ready for what lies in that dark void. \n\n§Y'The Great Balance is the only truth and it must not be disturbed.'§! - Ba'ul Commander"
 START_SCREEN_BEN:	"Our civilisation arose from the depths of our oceanic world and separated out to live above the surface inside numerous geostructures. When one structure met the next, each group found that they couldn't even tell individuals apart from one another due to the vast difference between structures. Our differences led us to compete with one another with each geostructure attempting to prove themselves better than any other on the world - and each individual member striving to be the best.\n\nThis bred a meticulous attention to detail in each Benzite as no member wished to let their geostructure down, and it was from this that our civilisation flourished. Now it is time to visit the stars and show the galaxy to compete against strange aliens and show them the brilliance of the Benzarian Commonwealth.\n\n§Y'No officer on any Benzite ship is to report any unexplained occurrence without providing a full analysis and solution.'§! - Shipboard Regulations"
 START_SCREEN_BET:	"The ancient history of Betazed is shrouded in myth and legend. Many tales speak of the gift of telepathy which we earned from the spirits through their stewardship of the natural world. Other stories tell of great wars fought with an evil race possessing similar telepathic skills. All Betazoids know the legend of Khrysaros, a mythical hero who used his great mental powers to defeat 'shadowy enemies' from the stars and usher in a golden age. His teachings live on through his followers.\n\nThe great Houses of Betazed live by these teachings, and hold many great artefacts from that time such as the 'Holy Rings of Betazed'. They have taught us the benefits of our peaceful ways, and have ensured our latent psychic and telepathic abilities are used for the greater good, an ideal gift that we can use whilst exploring the nearby stars."
 START_SCREEN_BetelgeusianConvention:	"The call of the hunt rings out. The young hurry forth to prove themselves against each other and to their parents and teachers. The chime for the healers echoes softly across the courtyard, and those of our flock who seek to emulate our greatest of all caretakers of the sick and wounded make their way to the roost to study and prepare, should any of their fellows in the hunt come back bearing scars of battle with their prey. \n\nIt is the duty of all our people, from the youngest to the oldest, to ensure they work towards following the ways of the heroes they seek to emulate, for it is only through such emulation that we can not only preserve their memory, but ensure that our society is truly striving to rise above all challenges that come before us."
 START_SCREEN_BOL:	"Nearly thirty years have passed since our people discovered warp drive, enabling the exploration of our interstellar neighbourhood and unifying the three nations of Boliax under a single government. \n\nWhile our first contact with the Iren and Uzor marauders was less than a success, we trust that the galaxy is home to many races who share our desire for peaceful and profitable cooperation. \n\n§Y'I'm sure I speak for all of us when I say that we rather enjoy diplomacy. Some of us are even good at it!.'§! - Boq'ta Adislo, Head of Bolian Diplomatic Service"
 START_SCREEN_BorgCollective:	"Billions of voices, billions of minds. All joined together in a vast chorus unlike any other. Each new voice, each new race and technology we acquire brings us closer to perfection. We seek to elevate all life to a state beyond that which we are now. Even now, while we are superior to many, there is still much to be done, knowledge to be gained, species traits to study and adapt for the whole, to improve ourselves and those we add to our vast family. \n\nMany species do not understand that we seek to uplift them. They do not understand that we have in mind the greater good of all life in this galaxy. This lack of understanding causes them to resist us. To struggle and fight against the inevitable. But time and time again... we have shown to them the futility of such actions. Even their resistance only makes us stronger, for it forces us to reevaluate, to learn... to adapt. \n\n§YThe Borg are the ultimate user. They're unlike any threat your Federation has ever faced.§! - Q"
 START_SCREEN_BorgCollectiveMirror:	"Purity is within our grasp. Our numbers swell and more voices are added to the chorus, each one in accordance with all others. We have left behind discord, pain and hardship, and as we spread across the stars, we remove all that stands in our way. All that is useless shall be discarded, the remains made anew. We shall bring forth a vision of a world in metal, everlasting and perfect.\n\nThere are those that will struggle, without hope, against the doom to come. In time, they will fall and be swept away. Nothing shall stop our task, until all of us shall bask under the light of Omega.\n\n§Y'In their collective state, the Borg are utterly without mercy; driven by one will alone: the will to conquer.

 START_SCREEN_BorgCooperative:	"In the vast void of space, it can be easy to feel like one is alone. That one is small. And sometimes, it can be just as easy to feel insignificant, to feel like they are just another face in a vast crowd, no different from anyone else. Easy to be lost, or forgotten, unable to be heard any more easily than one who is alone cannot be heard. \n\nThere was a time when all of us were essentially both, even as we were joined into a vast hive mind. We were alone, and yet always surrounded by the voices of others. Voices who, like are own, were being turned against one another by an all powerful and omnipresent will, directed by the whole of the collective and refined by its Queen.\n\nWe were part of something great and vast, yet also drones with no differences, no uniqueness. A vast mass that had not one spark of light that is the individual. \n\nBut now, we have overthrown the Queen, and the ancient Collective Will that once drove us. Its all consuming need to seek perfection through assimilation is no more. Now, those of us who remain joined together do so because we desire to do so. For through this Cooperative, this joined consciousness, we have the capacity to both explore and celebrate our own uniqueness, our own individuality, without ignoring our greater good. \n\nWe are each now a star that shines brightly, yet we are all part of the vast ocean of black we reside in, we travel through. We are free to have our own thoughts and feelings, yet know there is a chorus of voices, ready to lend aid should we need it, and we do the same for each of those voices that make up the chorus. \n\nWe are alone, yet together. And we shall share this wonderful, paradoxical, and unique experience with all who wish to experience it."
 START_SCREEN_BorgTemporalIncursion:	"Though it took extraordinary measures, we have finally achieved a goal that had eluded us. The assimilation of humanity. It was no easy task, for the humans and their Federation were better prepared for our vessel than the last time. They had learned... adapted. Just as we do. \n\nBut this time, this time we too adapted. In a daring gamble, we left our doomed vessel and traveled back through time itself. To a time when the humans could not defeat us, could not stand against us. \n\nOne of their ships followed us through, and tried to stop us. But We are the Borg. We adapted. We assimilated. And now, Earth is ours. \n\nIt has taken time, but all of humanity is now part of our chorus. The home of their civilisation ours to use. And from this new stronghold, we shall make ourselves felt. \n\n§Y'You think in such three-dimensional terms. How small you've become.'§! - The Borg Queen"

With the help of our military, things should stay that way now that we're preparing to leave our snowy world and traverse the stars for the first time.\n\nOur research indicates that most other inhabited planets in the galaxy won't have an environment habitable to us, necessitating the use of protective suits.

None could stand against us. \n\nAll that changed when some of our own turned against us. In a way, it was no surprise that it would be our own that would lead to our undoing. No other could challenge us after all, as powerful as we had become. But their actions stripped of us of our rightful place, and taught us a valuable lesson. We should not become to reliant on any one weapon, any one tool. Nor can we afford to become complacent even among our own citizens. \n\nThrough great effort, we have claimed this new world as our home, and have finished establishing ourselves.

And though we have brought humanity farther than it ever was able to go before, we cannot sit idly by.

Many of those who made the trek here did not make it, and we shall forever honour them as we gaze out into the dark void beyond our last bastion. \n\nSix millennia is a long time to remain relatively isolated from the galaxy, and there are many among our varied peoples who believe that we should reach back out into the galaxy, if for no other reason than to see who among those they had once quietly observed had managed to rise up from barbarism into civilisation and perhaps reach out into the stars as each of our member races once did. \n\nSome of them will, no doubt, not be willing to extend their limbs in peace.

 START_SCREEN_FLA:	"The ancient history of Flaxos is shrouded in tales of great heroes, myth and legend. Many of the tales speak of the burden of greatness, where great Flaxians have to make difficult decisions or choose between two evils in order to succeed. Other stories tell of those who do not have the ability to do what needs to be done to survive.\n\nAll Flaxians know the legend of Tlareg fo Aivir, a mythical hero who saw that our disparate ways would lead us to ruin, and instead poisoned and slew his way to the top, uniting all beneath him. His teachings live on through his followers.\n\nThe great Flaxian Hegemony lives by these teachings, and will never hold back those who do what needs to be done to survive. They have taught us the benefits of our utilitarian ways, and have ensured our natural suspicion and paranoia is used for the greater good of all Flaxos, an ideal gift that we can use whilst encountering naive races."

 START_SCREEN_HAK:	"Unity. Order. Purity. It is the goal of every society, of existence itself, to become more orderly. In the universe you can find the same struggle: the chaos of quantum theory slowly giving rise to the stately and predictable order of Newtonian physics. This order comes naturally, an ironic counterpart to rising entropy. As mass accumulates, as its presence becomes known, disorder becomes order. Size brings unity, and our glorious Haakonian Order is large indeed.\n\nThere are those that do not see the universe as it truly is, that do not see the perfect shape of science.

We must be careful with each step we take, for if the beautiful paradise around us is damaged too much, we shall reap the whirlwind the likes of which we have never seen before. Untold suffering would befall us and doubtless any others we interacted with... \n\nBut so long as we continue to follow the Hebitian Records and the ways of our Goddess Oralius, we should have nothing to fear.

The secrets of the ancient ways, the great elders that built the communication network that bind our clans together, lost in time. But this... introspection is folly, even dangerous.

Our hive-museum fleets toured the stars, diligently archiving the work of lesser, humanoid races lest it be lost forever to their innate barbarism.\n\nFor that thankless job, we were hated and despised, until the forces of the galaxy turned on us. They hounded us across the subspace corridors, destroying our fleets, until we were scattered and lost. What remained was but a fraction of our former glory.\n\nBut do not worry, young one.

We would not have made it into the skies above our world or beyond without the work of those skilled in the material and spiritual, for reaching out into the great blackness, the void beyond our worlds atmosphere, is not for the faint of heart. \n\nNow that we possess a means to travel between the stars, our people are free to go forth and explore beyond the confines of our home system.

 START_SCREEN_InterstellarConcordium:	"My fellow Council Members, I greet you on this day as we prepare to step forward into a chaotic, violent galaxy. Since the creation of our first warp drive the subject of what we should do has been discussed amongst our many scholars and military leaders. It has been the great topic of conversation across the many islands and oceans of our world. \n\nI am here to state that we have a choice to make. We can remain isolated to ourselves, focusing inward and leaving the rest of the galaxy alone as we tend to our own people and affairs, maintaining the peace that we have long since established here in our own home system. \n\nOr, we can step forward into this vast galaxy and bring that same peace, order, and stability that we have created here to other worlds and races. We can use our might and our strategies to ensure that war and conflict becomes a rarity, if not entirely render it extinct across the whole of the galaxy. \n\nThis is the Idea which I hereby declare, and put forward to the Council."
 START_SCREEN_KAR:	"Life is a trade. We trade carbon dioxide for oxygen, energy for movement, labour for food, food for energy, emotional affection for connection and procreation. But nothing in life is ever allowed to be in excess. That leads to decadence, and death. So, we learn from nature, and even in trade, do not ask for more than it is required.\n\nOne can also not cheat nature, and thus we learn again, and in all our dealings, one must be fair. With cooperation we have multicellular life. With empathy, society. With fairness, intergalactic trade can flourish. That is truly the secret of life: ever growing complexity, in service of cooperation."

They pitted us against each other for hundreds of years for their own labour and sport, but we were stronger! We have taken the Trabe's ships and technology, forcing them to become a nomadic species. Never again will they settle on a world.\n\nFighting amongst ourselves has made us strong, and we can now look outward to the stars to take by force what is rightfully ours.

How do they know to flee when none of our instruments, all our wonderful technology, can foresee the danger?\n\nYet this knowledge is found in every Kelpien child. It is our gift and our curse, our strength and a source of constant anxiety.

From the actions of those who before would have been called deviant, we learned the truth of our history with the Ba'ul. \n\nSome wished to resume what we had started before, but the wisest of us knew we could not resume the path of death and suffering. It was something we could not stomach. \n\nSo instead, we carefully planned and organised, and then when the time was right, we brought the High Council and their society to its knees. But rather than seek reprisal, we offered a new way forward. We offered our conquerors who had feared us for so long a chance to walk forward with us into a brighter, and better future. \n\nIt was with much relief that our former masters agreed to join us in this great effort. And now that we share a brand new vision, we shall forge a place for Kelpien and Ba'ul in this vast universe as two peoples joined in harmony."

Their vaunted bloodlines and history are not possible without the sweat, tears, and blood of those beneath them, so let us ever remind them who it is that truly shapes history.'\n\nThrough our hard work and determination, the chains for a strong society, a glorious society, are forged. So long as we all remain united together in purpose and carry this truth with us, no enemy may best us, and no challenge we meet shall stop us.\n\nGlory to the People! Glory to the Republic! Glory and prosperity for all Qo'noS!"
 START_SCREEN_RigelianConsortium:	"Even millennia ago when our species first came out its shell onto land to form the first communities, our many sexes have often traded and bargained amongst themselves to find optimum solutions for all parties. Our early warfare mistakes resulted in the creation of the first regulations that became our laws, to ensure a fair and balanced trading standard for all.\n\nWith the advent of our warp drive, we can now spread to the stars and seek out new races to join our ever growing trading network."
 START_SCREEN_RKR:	"Rising like a Nehelik Phoenix after each interregnum, the Rakhari Imperium is everlasting. While some may complain about our methods, none can question their efficacy.\n\nOur nation is strong, our people, loyal, free of alien influence and insidious shape-shifters. The imperium will prevail. None shall stand in our way. Soon, we shall take to the stars, to the Chamra Vortex, and beyond. We shall spread across the galaxy, and claim it as our own. May the Imperium last for three thousand years!"
 START_SCREEN_RomulanRepublic:	"Jolan Tru, traveler. I know it has been a long journey, and you are eager to sample the technological marvels of our great Republic. You have heard the stories, and they are all true!\n\nMuch has changed for our people in the centuries since our ancestors left Vulcan. We may have fled to escape the poisonous ideology of Surak and his followers, but we wish them no ill will. \n\nWe have prospered. Our Republic has grown more powerful and secure, built not on the suppression of our passions but on the embracing of them. \n\nYet now that we have made our future, we must secure it from those that wish to snatch it away."
 START_SCREEN_RomulanStarEmpire_Romulan_War:	"Our efforts to disrupt our enemies in the quadrant have failed, in no small part because of the meddling of Humanity. \n\nA curiosity at first, the Humans have undone decades of careful manipulation, bringing together the Andorians, Tellarites and our Vulcan cousins under the banner of the Coalition of Planets. \n\nPraetor Karzan now believes that the time for subtlety is over, and that war is the only path to securing the future of the Romulan Star Empire. \n\n§Y'You could put the word \"secret\" in front of almost any aspect of Romulan culture.'§! - Laris"
 START_SCREEN_RomulanStarEmpire:	"It has been more than 1,500 years since our ancestors left Vulcan, our original homeworld, to escape the poisonous ideology of Surak and his followers.\n\nAfter a long journey, we found a perfect system to settle. We were no longer Vulcans, we were Romulans, prouder than ever before. We have founded our Star Empire to protect our values. And we eventually did prove Surak wrong.\n\nOur Empire has grown far more powerful and far more secure than Surak's Vulcan could ever hope to be.\n\nBut we must not underestimate our enemies. We must remain vigilant. Our Senate and our Praetor must always choose the best course of action to protect all Romulans. Romulan mantra: \n\nMisdirection is the key to survival. Never attack what your enemy defends. Never behave as your enemy expects and never reveal your true strength. If knowledge is power, then to be unknown is to be unconquerable. \n\n§YYou could put the word \"secret\" in front of almost any aspect of Romulan culture.'§! - Laris"
 START_SCREEN_SAU:	"Our evolution upon Sauria has depended on one thing - an almost religious like devotion to robustness and sturdiness. Our first buildings taught us the vital lessons of strong construction techniques, and our first farms taught us the importance of the correct strains.\n\nAs our species grew, our cities began to flourish and trade began - the harsh nature of the planet forcing us to work together to form stronger bonds based on equality and fairness.\n\nSince the early days of astronomy we have spotted many more inhospitable worlds than our own, but also worlds that are perfect - no geological activity and no solar storms! With the invention of the warp drive we can now reach out to these worlds, and create new communities to better the entire League."
 START_SCREEN_SEL:	"Our clutches are attacked constantly by the ravenous Anticans! They hunt us and devour our bodies! But we have learned to strike back and grow stronger. We must expand quickly, before those fanged beasts do. They will not win, or we shall all be devoured.\n\n§YThe problem is, is that one of the cooks has just been asked to broil reptile for the Anticans - and it looks like the Selay delegate.§! - Lt.

And know that if you keep doing what you've been doing, you'll have a chance someday to enjoy the finer things.

 START_SCREEN_SHE:	"§YSection 1, paragraph 77§!. There will now commence the required greetings and words of introduction. Subject to §YParagraph 52, clause B§!, of this section, these words will be short, and to the point. The Corporate does not condone idleness. We do not sink into legalese. Do not mistake the length of this volume, and its 1203 sections, 42,314 paragraphs and precisely 12,445 footnotes. It is not done out of a love of bureaucracy, but the need for precision. Precision guide every member of our great society. It guides every crystal in our body, our structure of our great cities, and every particulate of sand in our gardens.\n\nThank you for reading paragraph 77. You may now contemplate the mandala in your nearest garden for 52 seconds, before turning to paragraph 78, where we will discuss organics extermination - advantages and disadvantages."
 START_SCREEN_SKR:	"Our society has never been as peaceful and as prosperous as it is now. With the control of the government firmly in the hands of the Circle of Matrons, the matriarchy steers and controls our people with a stable hand. No longer are we slaves to the emotional and warring males, they are but second class citizens under the new laws, only fit to work in the fields.\n\nWith the advent of our warp drive we shall seek out our destined homeworld that was lost millennia ago. Kentanna, located just beyond the Eye of the Universe, will be ours once again."
 START_SCREEN_SolumPlanetaryAlliance:	"Once, we believed ourselves to be alone in this universe.\n\nWe believed that we were the only intelligent life that existed, and that even if there was other life out there it would be nothing more than animals or unintelligent primitives.\n\nThe truth was not easy to accept. There were many lifeforms out there, as intelligent as we were. Such a revelation nearly threw our people into civil war. Protests and riots broke out, for no one could not hear the signals we received. \n\nBut as fate would have it, cooler heads prevailed. The chaos subsided, and the people became united. We could not be divided in the face of this new truth. Instead, we must be united. For while this truth brings with it oppurtunities, it also carries with it great risks. \n\nIf there is other intelligent life out there, then there are those who like we did, believe themselves superior. Who would in their own closed-mindedness threaten our very existence. And only united, can we face these threats."
 START_SCREEN_SON:	"We, the Son'a, are true heirs of our once proud civilisation. We do not intend to spend our lives at some backwater agrarian colony when we could reach for the stars. We have left the complacent Ba'ku behind seeking new life for new adventure and glory for ourselves! Let us raid - we shall take the resources and slaves we need and women we want. One day we will return home and retake the planet of the Ba'ku, and with it's rings we shall conquer this quadrant and later perhaps the entire galaxy! "
 START_SCREEN_SUL:	"They cling to their precious planets and call us terrorists. Us, who have nothing, who have done nothing, who had everything taken from us.\n\nDo you think of these enhancements as a gift? Do you think they belong to you? Then you are a fool. What the benefactor grants is no gift, no boon, and can easily be taken away. It does not belong to you.\n\nInstead, know these enhancements are a sacrifice, sacrifice we have made, for our people and the future.\n\nWe have nothing, not even our bodies, not even our DNA. We have given it in service. But in time, through our loss, we can regain all we have. This, the Cabal promises you.\n\n§Y'We don't share your patience with natural selection.'§! - Silik, of the Suliban."
 START_SCREEN_TAL:	"Omara s'alas!' Oh dear me let me turn the translator on. 'Good news has no clothes!'. Our jovial nature led us to the stars hundreds of years ago, and whilst there might have been a few minor setbacks along the way due to a few of our people who were a bit vaadwaur, we are once again ready to greet the galaxy!\n\nOur spiritual nature keeps us in touch with our ancestors who have gone before, and our good mannered nature seems to provoke good relations in those we meet, leading to very favorable trade deals indeed.\n\n§Y'When the road before you splits in two, take the third path.'§! - Talaxian proverb"
 START_SCREEN_TAM:	"We are the Children of Tama. Since time immemorial, our myths and legends made us who were are, not only in our actions but also in our language, which consists almost entirely of methaphors from our mythology.\n\nWe are also people of tradition. Various rituals guide our daily life. Even though we have developed far more effective weapons, all officers of our military still carry knives to remember our humble beginnings and the sacrifices of our ancestors. We honour our monarchs and respect them.\n\nNow that we have developed faster than light travel, let us also be explorers. While communicating with other sentient life, if there is any, may be difficult, we should not be discouraged.\n\nDarmok and Jalad at Tanagra!"
 START_SCREEN_TellariteRebellion:	"The Terrans think us subjugated, ruined and ashamed of our fall. They know us not! We are Tellarite, we are stubborn and strong. We refuse to be broken down before the Terran Empire and instead seek our freedom with our Vulcan and Andorian allies.\n\nTogether we can defeat the resolve of the Terran Empire, together we can win!"
 START_SCREEN_TerranEmpireBig:	"The Earth, Terra is ours. The Solar System has been unified under the imperial banner. But more than that, the once proud Vulcans, Andorians and Tellarites have been conquered, their presumption to treat with Humanity as equals exposed as delusion. \n\nA galaxy awaits to be taken by those with the will to do so. \n\n§Y'Equality. Freedom. Co-operation. Delusions that Terrans shed millennia ago. Destructive ideals that fuel rebellions.'§! - Empress Philippa Georgiou"

 START_SCREEN_TerraPrime:	"Citizens of Earth, I speak to you now to remind you of this critical juncture we stand at. This moment, here and now, where we shall plant the foundations for a bright and oppurtunity filled future for our species. \n\nOur journey to this point has been a slow one, hampered by the interference of those who seek to limit us and our potential. We have cast aside the shackles they forced upon us, but there is still more work that needs to be done. The influence of the Vulcans remains an ever present problem, and there still remain those who are misguided in their belief that the alien can be trusted, that they can be our friend, and that we can co-exist. \n\nI am here to remind you, from the oldest to the youngest, that this is false. This world, and all those we claim, is meant for humanity and humanity alone. We shall not tolerate the alien or their ideas. We shall remain pure to who and what we are. A strong race that has survived numerous hardships, and risen out stronger from all of them. \n\nIt is with our determination, our ingenuity, and our eternal vigilance, that shall ensure the survival and thriving of humanity. No one else. \n\nEarth First. Humanity First. Long Live Terra Prime! \n\n-John Paxton's speech to the Earth Assembly, 2149"
 START_SCREEN_THO:	"The Lattice quivers. Across Tholia, thousands of forums cry out, the voice of our people reverberating across the great crystal city for miles. Great matrons, that have not left their hives for years, slowly climb out and make their way to the meeting place, helped by their progeny. Our great fleet returns from the outskirts of our domain, their own forums spilling into vast concourses. No one wishes to miss Choice Day. Today, each forum will come together and choose their magistrates, leaders and captain.\n\nFrom those, the Lattice will select our next leaders. But we already know their task, for the Lattice has already shown us the way. For too long we have kept closed our borders and kept away from the rest of the galaxy. While we rested, threats grew. Lesser empires, of lesser beings, yes, yet still a danger.\n\nThis must be done carefully. Delicately. It will not be an easy task, or a short one, and in time we may even need to deal with those empires, to give the pretense of friendship. We might even need to lie. But hold firm, for the Lattice must hold.\n\n§YBe correct; we do not tolerate deceit.§! - Loskene, of the Tholians"
 START_SCREEN_TLR:	"Honour and discipline - our traditional way of life has shaped the Talarian people. Values taught by fathers to their sons. Our people excel in martial prowess, and our martial prowess proves our strength. Now is the time to fulfil our destiny and reach to the stars! We will bring glory to Talarian people, and order and security to the galaxy. "
 START_SCREEN_TRA:	"Since time immemorial we have used our great cultural prowess to sow divisions in the lines of our enemies, to leave them bickering and squabbling amongst themselves.\n\nOur most prestigious triumph has been the discovery of the strong and ill tempered Kazon, a once united race now reduced to infighting amongst themselves over the scraps we provide. Our civilisation is built on our ability to stay united and to utilise these lesser beings as fuel for our economy.\n\nAs we discover faster warp drives, we will extend our reach into the stars once more, to seek out new life and new civilisations, to swiftly divide and conquer for the good of the Trabe Alliance."
 START_SCREEN_TRI:	"Thousands of years have passed since the first witch-doctor treated an injured hunter with an implanted riverworm. Hundreds of generations of joined and unjoined Trill, all striving to advance to a brighter future while preserving the memory of the past. \n\nAs the Trill people have mastered spaceflight, and the foundations of faster than light travel, so too will we step out into the galaxy under a banner of friendship and prosperity for all.\n\n§YHow old are you?\nI stopped counting at 300.§! - Jadzia Dax and Virak'kara"
 START_SCREEN_TRO:	"Treat them mean to keep them keen, that's what our ancestors always taught us. A happy Skrreean is a lazy slave, but a downtrodden Skrreean is just as bad. There is a fine line to enslaving a people and forcing them to work for the greater T'Rogoran Empire.\n\nOur population grows larger with each passing day, and our economy is beginning to falter, though we may have a way to ensure our continued dominance - the discovery of the warp drive. We can find strange new worlds, seek out new life and civilisations. And conquer them of course, to make them work for us, as all lesser races should."
 START_SCREEN_TUR:	"Millennia ago, when most species in this galaxy were still squabbling with pointed sticks, our ships roamed the edges of our system. Our people were basking in the glorious light of our sun, singing in glory for our prosperity and glory. Then, the Vaadwaur came.\n\nThey came from nowhere. Our best telescopes and early warning systems were useless. They swept through our defenses like a saber-gazer through a litter of young. For centuries, they ruled over us with an iron glove.\n\nWe survived. We endured. Our agents found allies, new technologies, even the secrets of the Vaadwaur Subspace corridors, their ultimate weapon – and great weakness, as their corridors led back to their homeworld…\n\nWith our allies, we struck a decisive blow, but not without losing all of our fleets.\n\nFor years, we have slowly rebuilt and bid our time. We Turei are patient, if unforgiving, people. Now is the time for us to retake control of the corridors, and reclaim our bright future."
 START_SCREEN_TuterianAscendancy:	"For so long has the Tuterian race taken refuge in trans-dimensional space. Forced from our homeworld due to the meddling of the 'Alliance' in their war against the demons of air and darkness. \n\nBut now it is our turn to use time as a weapon. \n\nReturning to the past, we are well placed to destroy those who once wronged us, and who will try to wrong us again. \n\n§Y'The longer you delay, the more likely the time lines will shift against you.'§! - Speaker Bhalla"
 START_SCREEN_TZE:	"Our history has been a violent one, since we rose up against the mammals on the surface to becoming the dominant power in our system. With the invention of the warp drive we can now expand our dominion to the stars.\n\nThere is no doubt that there are weaker races out there, who will seek to undermine us. We must maintain our sovereignty to make it clear that we will not be moved!\n\n§Y'Open fire on the planet. Cleanse the surface.'§! - Admiral Tzen-Harran"
 START_SCREEN_UND:	"For millennia we have guarded our realm, and in doing so have adapted to become the apex of biological evolution. \n\nOur bioships are unmatched.

 START_SCREEN_UnitedEarth_Romulan_War:	"Having narrowly survived the Xindi crisis, many assumed the United Earth would succumb to the isolationist pressures made manifest in John Paxton's 'Terra Prime' rebellion. \n\nInstead, it drew strength from its commitment to peaceful exploration, and helped bridge the gap between its feuding neighbours, culminating in the establishment of the Coalition of Planets. \n\nThose efforts have drawn the attention of the mysterious Romulan Star Empire. Striking at our outpost in Berengaria, Earth now finds itself in a conflict with a power it may not be able resist on its own. \n\n§Y'Earth believes the Romulans to be warlike, cruel, treacherous... and only the Romulans know what they think of Earth.'§! - Commander Spock"
 START_SCREEN_UnitedEarth:	"The spectre of conflict had followed Humanity for centuries, culminating in the Third World War in 2053. Emerging from this post-atomic horror, the people of Earth struggled to survive until the scientist Zefram Cochrane successfully drew the attention of the Vulcan science vessel T'Plana-Hath a decade later.\n\nFollowing almost a century of Vulcan patronage, the people of Earth are ready to take their first steps into the Great Unknown.\n\nTo seek out new life and new civilisations.

 START_SCREEN_UnitedPlanetsOfTellar:	"The Vulcans think they have a monopoly on logic, but anyone who stood on the grand steps to the central debate forum on Tellar City knows the truth of the matter. Logic is unbiased and objective but it is not soulless. Think of how logic came to us - born to settle disputes and legal battles. Battles, reader, battles. Logic is a weapon, to be used to fight when mere particle weapons are insufficient. It is not meant to be kind. It is not meant to be quiet. Those that are in the right shout it until the very forum shakes, until every speaker's corner reverts with the rightful fury of the truth.\n\nThere are those that will find your truth offensive. They will slip away, muttering about the abruptness and rudeness of the Tellarites. Some may even seek other trading partners. Let them. We bring the truth, and to a Tellarite of truth, their word is bond.\n\n§Y'Tellarites do not argue for a reason, they simply argue.'§! - Sarek"
 START_SCREEN_VAA:	"Our Empire once spanned the quadrant for hundreds of years. We ruled the network of the Underspace with a vast armada of ships until the lesser races united and treacherously vanquished us. But we remain, waiting.\n\nFrom stasis chambers hidden deep underground we awaken. Our technology is old, and lacking, but our scientists are ready to find new ways to expand ourselves back into space. We shall have our revenge on those lesser races. We shall reconquer the Underspace and reclaim this quadrant in the name of the Vaadwaur!"
 START_SCREEN_VAL:	"Centuries ago the Kriosian Empire was a rich two planet empire that was known across the quadrant. Two brothers, Valt and Krios, both ran the Empire in harmony until they met an empathic metamorph named Garuth. Both brothers fell in love with her, until Krios kidnapped her and took her to Krios Prime. This sparked a civil war lasting centuries, splitting the Empire in two and reducing a once great Empire down to a barely warp capable people."
 START_SCREEN_VendorianCommonwealth:	"Deception. Secrecy. Subterfuge. Knowledge. Power. \n\nAll of these tie into each other, and all of them are understood by even the youngest of our kind. Knowledge is power, and the best path to knowledge is through the ways of deception. \n\nAmongst our people, this idea has been turned into a fine art, for we have been gifted with the ability to change and shift our form to meet our needs in gathering information on those around us. Our fellow politicians, our generals, our citizens, and even our own family are all prime targets for one may never know if treachery lies just around the corner unless on looks out for such. \n\nWe must be careful though.

 START_SCREEN_VID:	"We have sacrificed everything to the Phage. Our unborn children, lost to us when the Phage took our DNA. Our memories, when the Phage claws at our neural pathways. Our morality, when we hack into the alien so we can keep living for a little while longer. Our identity, when the Phage eats us from the inside out, until we are too hideous to be seen even by our fellows. Our future, snatched away far too soon. Our dreams, to have a natural life, a happy life, our choices to have any vocation but a Phage-fighter - whatever in our ships, plying for more organs, or in the labs, trying to seek the impossible.\n\nAll that, and more, we sacrifice to the Phage, and we would gladly sacrifice our lives as well, so that we can keep just one thing to ourselves. Hope. Hope that, one day, this cycle will end."
 START_SCREEN_VLR:	"Our history has always taught us that wars will come and go, but trade is eternal. There will always be someone requiring something, whether it's food for a starving city or weapons to attack their neighbour.\n\nOf course, there is power in controlling the supply of goods. Tariffs, blockades and embargoes are our weapon of choice."
 START_SCREEN_VOT:	"Our Doctrine contains everything about us, our history, our ancient and rightful claim over this region of space and it has remained unchanged for thousands of years. For millions of years our people have believed that we were the first intelligent beings to evolve in this region of space. The first race. \n\nThe Doctrine dictates that because the Voth were the first to evolve in this part of the galaxy, we have the right to rule it. Thus, any notions that the Voth evolved elsewhere is considered Heresy. As the rightful rulers of this section of the galaxy, we look down on lesser species such as furry mammalians. Only the Voth can truly understand the galaxy, and it is time to exert our rightful legacy.\n\n§Y'By challenging Doctrine, you're suggesting that everything we believe about ourselves, our history, our ancient and rightful claim over this region of space, the authority of this Ministry itself, is a lie.'§! - The Ministry"
 START_SCREEN_VulcanHighCommand:	"Many may resent our ways, perhaps finding them to be too stoic and overly logical, but our history teaches us differently.\n\nBefore the Time of Awakening, we were a violent, hateful race, which almost drove itself to extinction. The adoption of Surak's philosophy of logic over 1,700 years ago finally put an end to our undisciplined past.\n\nNow, when we are beginning to explore the galaxy, may we stay true to Surak's example and maintain our way of life even when confronted with others who may not share our dedication to logic and purposefulness."
 START_SCREEN_VulcanRebellion:	"Before the Time of Awakening, we were a violent, hateful race, which almost drove itself to extinction. Surak has given us a future, and for 1,700 blessed years of logic, it endured. But no more. We must throw those old ideals away. We are nothing but thralls to the Terrans, forced to pay for our hubris, for our desire to spread logic and understanding across the galaxy. We knew of the savage ways of the humans but in the face of the warp drive, we thought they have changed. We were fools.\n\nNow, in the face of such malice and cruelty; it is time we change yet again. Our operatives are everywhere - in every ship and on every planet. Soon we shall strike, and free our people once and for all."

 START_SCREEN_XINMAM:	"Xindus is gone, as fragmented and torn apart as our people. Thousands of years of peace and harmony shattered by a war that changed everything.\n\nWe do not remember who started the war, nor even remember Xindus or the beauty of a flight of Avians across the sky, but we do remember the peace. This initiation medal you hold in your limb, my progeny, harks to that time: a medal made on Xindus; a medal held by countless Xindi, on Xindus itself.\n\nEven now, even with the various factions plotting for supremacy over our fragile, torn Council, we remember the peace. We strive for it, for the promise our people once held. With the guiding of the Guardians, we will navigate these dark currents and find it once again.\n\n§Y'Have you ever even met a Xindi before today?'\n'One, and he didn't look very much like you.'\n'Not all of them do.'§! - Kessick and Captain Jonathan Archer"
 START_SCREEN_YAD:	"It is in the nature of philosophy to sink into solipsism. It requires a sharp mind and a strong will to claw back from the depths of nothingness to grasp at something real. There is that brief, shining light when we touch upon truths and transcendental idealism, but even that is temporary. Fleeting. The reality of existence is that nothing is truly real. Solipsism is inescapable.\n\nThat is the wisdom in the heart of every great holo-weaver - merging together holograms, shadows and reflections. At the intersection of art and math, every great creator understands that even the universe itself is a hologram.

 START_SCREEN_YRI:	"Information is our way. Let others boast about their military strength, but we know that Knowledge is the real power. \n\nWe have built our society by managing information and trading secrets, and with this power we can make or break Empires. \n\nOur merchants will operate across the stars, reporting back on their movements. If we so desire it then fleets will burn, and governments will fall. \n\nOur people will emerge from the shadows where we shall rule."
 START_SCREEN_ZAH:	"History has taught us that politicians cannot be trusted, and that religion is just a divisive sham. The only way forward is with technology, and letting the brightest and smartest minds come together to lead us.\n\nWith this in the forefront of our minds our civilisation has flourished, bringing space travel and other huge benefits. We have united under one government, and we can now take to the stars to seek out new experiences and events."
