 #STNC_federation_story.2272.desc:	"[Root.GetCaptainTitle] [Root.Leader.GetName] gives an open and honest explanation of their presence, including the importance of their unusual cargo. \n\nCaptain Ndoye is at first sceptical but is eventually persuaded, and a detailed scan of the [Root.GetFleetName] provides ample evidence that the story is true. \n\nShe states that the current year is 3188. The [Root.GetFleetName] has massively overshot their targetted temporal destination. \n\nBoth agree that the Temporal Prime Directive applies, and Ndoye cannot hinder [Root.GetCaptainTitle] [Root.Leader.GetName] since the risk of damage to the timeline would be too great. \n\nFrom this [Root.Leader.GetName] surmises that the [Root.GetFleetName] must ultimately succeed in its mission and, with confidence, the crew prepares to execute one last temporal slingshot manoeuvre."

 anomaly_failure.400.desc_STH:	"For unclear reasons, the resident Science Officer decided to take out a shuttle from the [Root.GetName] to personally investigate the moon [From.From.GetName]. An explosion was detected shortly afterwards when the shuttle impacted the surface at full impulse.\n\nA review of redundant log files verified that the drone had several miscalculations due to a flaw in its cortical implant. We have initiated an update to all further implants."
 anomaly.1.desc.borg:	"Although the Collective's data archives have examined it repeatedly, all calculations point towards asteroid [From.GetName] being coprolite - a piece of fossilised feces from some kind of massive life form. It appears to be almost a billion years old, and much of the fossil's original organic composition has been replaced by mineral deposits. The mineral deposits will be useful to the Collective."
 anomaly.10.a.borg:	"Their biological distinctiveness will be added to our own."
 anomaly.10.desc.borg:	"Whilst conducting a survey of [From.GetName], the drones of the [Root.GetName] picked up several life signs coming from within the asteroid. There appears to be a colony of large, burrowing worm-like lithovores within the rock, which has been riddled with tunnels. These unique imperfect life forms have somehow adapted to a life in the coldness of space."
 anomaly.15.desc.borg:	"Fossils from what appears to be several species of aquatic lifeforms have been found on the barren and airless surface of [From.GetName]. There are indications that the surrounding asteroid belt was created from the remains of a shattered planet, and these findings seem to confirm that theory. Calculations via the fossils indicate this planet once supported life and was at least partially covered by water."
 anomaly.25.a.borg:	"The technological distinctiveness will be added to our own."
 anomaly.25.desc.borg:	"A large portion of asteroid [From.GetName] has been hollowed out to allow for the construction of some kind of shipyard. It has been abandoned and exposed to the vacuum of space for hundreds of cycles - we have not detected anything useful onboard. The design of the shipyard itself is unique, however, and much could potentially be learned by its assimilation."
 anomaly.30.a.borg:	"It will be assimilated."
 anomaly.30.desc.borg:	"This asteroid was used as a junkyard by imperfect beings in the distant past. All manner of discarded machinery and metallic refuse has been deposited inside the asteroid's weak gravity well, being slowly pulled into the jumble of debris that now covers the surface. There is nothing of particular value to be found here, but a lot of the metal could be salvaged by a mining station to add to the Collective."
 anomaly.300.desc.borg:	"The Collective has discovered a thriving ecosystem in the upper atmosphere of the gas giant [From.GetName]. Massive floating creatures, having evolved bodies filled with lighter than air gases, follow the wind currents and feed off the energy released by the gas giant's frequent lightning storms. These beings in turn support colonies of smaller animals that prey on atmospheric plankton and each other."
 anomaly.3030.desc.squadron:	"There is a squadron of small vessels idling on the plains of [From.GetName], their sensors reacting to the [Root.GetName] in orbit around the planet.\n\nThe [Root.GetName]'s crew have been unable to confirm exactly when the ships were abandoned - for they are abandoned - or who left them there, or where they are now. According to Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName], remotely activating the lightly armed ships would be trivial, should we wish to add the squadron to our fleets."
 anomaly.305.desc.borg:	"A discarded cargo pod was left by someone in the upper atmosphere of [From.GetName] long ago. It has somehow escaped the notice of other spacefarers, and its decaying orbit means it would have been lost in the gas giant's crushing atmosphere within another few cycles. When the drones of the [Root.GetName] unsealed the pod, they found a stash of alien jewelry made out of precious metals, these metals could be refined to service us."
 anomaly.310.desc.borg:	"A small aerostat colony was found floating just above the atmosphere of [From.GetName]. Sensor sweeps indicate it to have been self-sufficient, and remains from several different species were found on board.\n\nFurther analysis indicates the colony was some kind of social experiment conducted centuries ago that ultimately ended with the colonists massacring each other. We have assimilated all of the data found in the colony's limited databanks and added them to the Collective."
 anomaly.315.desc.borg:	"A ruined network of aerostat colonies dating back at least three millennia can be found in low orbit of this gas giant. Their original function appears to have been gas mining, but they have since been abandoned and reoccupied by many different races and pirate groups.\n\nThe colonies have been thoroughly stripped of anything even remotely valuable, but the mere fact that they are still aloft after all this time makes them an interesting subject of knowledge to assimilate."
 anomaly.320.desc.borg:	"The strong gravity well of [From.GetName] has pulled in a massive amount of space debris which has formed a dense layer around parts of the gas giant. Most of it appears to be wreckage from a series of space battles fought in the system several millennia ago.\n\nScavengers have already scoured the debris of valuable technologies and artifacts, but a mining station should be able to recycle the metal and add it to serve the Collective."
 anomaly.325.a.borg:	"Its technological distinctiveness will be added to our own."
 anomaly.325.desc.borg:	"The shattered remnants of a primitive starship can be detected in a decaying orbit deep inside the atmosphere of [From.GetName]. It appears to have ventured far into the gas giant's atmosphere, perhaps in a desperate attempt to escape a pursuer, only to be crushed by the atmospheric pressure.\n\nThe vessel is too deep to be assimilated, but a structural sensor sweep of the wreckage has provided us with some interesting engineering data which we could add to the Collective."
 anomaly.330.desc.borg:	"[From.GetName] frequently experiences massive and extremely violent storm systems in its atmosphere. Several dozen persistent storms are visible from orbit, with winds often reaching speeds in excess of 700 m/s. The cause of these storms is not immediately apparent, as we have found nothing in the planet's climate model that would explain them. The Collective is interested in analyzing this anomaly."
 anomaly.335.desc.borg:	"The [Root.GetName] has picked up a strange energy signature coming from somewhere deep inside the atmosphere of [From.GetName]. It appears to originate from a structure of some kind, possibly the remains of an orbital station, but the atmospheric pressure makes it impossible to approach. Nevertheless, scans of the unique signature have yielded a large amount of valuable physics data which will be added to the Collective."
 anomaly.35.a.borg:	"Its technological distinctiveness will be added to our own."
 anomaly.35.desc.borg:	"A small scout craft of unknown design plowed into the surface of this asteroid millennia ago, creating a shallow canyon. There is no visible cockpit on the ship, leading the Collective to understand it was either piloted by remote or through some kind of primitive artificial intelligence. Although it is too damaged to be recovered in its entirety, the ship may still contain useful information to the Collective."
 anomaly.40.desc.alt.borg:	"Sensor nodes have detected an automated mining base built in close orbit around asteroid [From.GetName]. There are large chunks of the hull missing, the jagged holes indicative of heavy weapons damage. The station is beyond repair, but salvaging it will provide the Collective with valuable materials."
 anomaly.40.desc.borg:	"Sensor nodes have detected an automated mining base built in close orbit around asteroid [From.GetName]. There is scorching on the hull indicative of light weapons damage, and the facility appeared to be stuck in some kind of feedback loop. Our drones have managed to reprogram the base systems and the facility is now fully assimilated."
 anomaly.5.a.borg:	"It will be assimilated."
 anomaly.5.desc.borg:	"This asteroid appears to have been used intermittently as a base by imperfect beings one thousand cycles ago. A drone retrieval team entered the base and managed to recover abandoned material. It consisted largely of crude trinkets and artifacts, but some of it may be of value to the Collective."
 anomaly.50.desc.borg:	"Asteroid [From.GetName] is pockmarked with craters from weapon blasts, and it appears to have been used as a target range by an unknown species roughly two thousand cycles ago. Residual energy readings suggest they tested increasingly exotic weaponry, including subspace bombs and some kind of singularity generator. Analysis of the unusual weapon echoes may prove useful to the Collective."
 anomaly.55.a.borg:	"The minerals will service us."
 anomaly.55.desc.borg:	"Upon closer examination, drones have discovered that a smaller asteroid consisting almost entirely of rare precious metals recently collided with [From.GetName]. A small, but dense, cache of metals was hidden just beneath the asteroid's surface, but now that it has been discovered, it is accessible to mining drones."
 anomaly.60.desc.borg:	"This particular asteroid is an extrasolar capture, and it appears to have been washed by some kind of exotic radiation as it plummeted through interstellar space before finally settling in the [From.GetStarName] system.

These creatures were detected on surveyed habitable worlds, but they are difficult to capture due to their capacity to elude our sensors or local environmental constraints. It will require the full resources of a Survey Vessel for a lengthy period of time."
 country.54.desc.borg:	"After an extensive search of the seabed on [From.From.GetName] using a small fleet of aquatic drones, the [Root.GetName] has finally managed to corner the target of the Collective's search - a live tarblac. \n\nThe shimmering creature, which defends itself by emitting faint psionic signals that produce a sense of dread in most organic species, was brought aboard the Science Vessel in a special water tank simulating its natural environment. Drones which have come into direct contact with the tarblac will require software patching, but the operation has been a success."
 country.55.desc.borg:	"The tassargoid is an extremely lethal predator that stalks the dense jungles of [From.From.GetName] at night, paralyzing its prey with electric shocks before sucking their brains out with its tube-like mouth.\n\nThree drones from the [Root.GetName] were lost to these creatures before a specimen could be secured."
 country.56.desc.borg:	"The small, rodent-like creatures known as orinthi are native to [From.From.GetName], where their habitat extends across most of the [From.From.GetPlanetMoon]'s diverse climatic regions. They breed at an extremely rapid rate, and seem to have a particular fondness for chewing on EPS cables.\n\nProcuring specimens was not a problem - in fact, after the initial creatures were collected, more of them made their way onto the [Root.GetName] by attaching themselves to our drones prior to their beaming back to the Science Vessel."
 country.57.desc.borg:	"Snirans are large, burrowing creatures that live beneath the dunes of the vast equatorial deserts on [From.From.GetName]. When these predators sense movement in the sands above, they immediately raise dozens of tall spikes from their backs in the hope of impaling something edible.\n\nFinding a suitable specimen proved difficult at first, until hundreds of drones were dispatched across the desert in random directions. This led to the discovery and procurement of an unusually large specimen that had grown more than a hundred spikes on its back."
 country.58.desc.borg:	"Goolanthas are large, flat herbivores that have evolved internal gas pockets, enabling them to hover a few centimeters above the ground. They move about in herds consisting of a few dozen animals, grazing on the moss and lichen that can be found on the windswept plains of [From.From.GetName].\n\nThey are ruthlessly hunted by the [From.From.GetPlanetMoon]'s apex predators, and local analysis units estimate that only a few hundred goolantha herds remain. One of these, consisting of nine animals, has been successfully collected and will be brought back to [Root.Owner.Capital.GetName] for full assimilation."
 country.59.desc.borg:	"Drones from the [Root.GetName] have managed to collect a small group of uddlorans from the icy surface of [From.From.GetName]. These white, furry omnivores wrap themselves into tight balls and roll across the [From.From.GetPlanetMoon]'s snow fields at astonishing speeds - one animal was detected with a velocity of 81.4 kilometers per decacycle. This aided in their detection, since the passage of their rolling forms raised huge plumes of swirling snow."
 country.60.desc.borg:	"The Zulcor are swarming insect analogues, unusual both for their large size and the fact that they are lithovores, feeding off rocks and minerals in the ground. Several drones sustained serious damage when they inadvertently passed through a large swarm, and several zulcors began to feed on their exposed cybernetic components. \n\nForce fields were required to hold these creatures prior to their transport to [Root.Owner.Capital.GetName] for full assimilation."

Nevertheless, this discovery could hold the key to understanding how to fully control or even replicate similar gates."
 STNC_exploration_events.3060.desc.survey_empty_reservoirs:	"The §Y[FromFrom.GetName]§! has transmitted an update on the progress of its mission to survey in detail the exterior of the §Y[FromFromFrom.GetName]§!. \n\n[Root.GetCaptainTitle] [From.GetFormalName] reports the discovery of a vast empty reservoir, apparently intended to store liquid water in a series of monolithic tanks near the access gate. \n\nThe reservoir spans several hundred square kilometres and seems to be connected to a distribution network that branches out into the sphere's inner regions. \n\nThis finding implies that water was brought to the sphere from other worlds, but for a species that possessed the incredible technology required to build the sphere itself, this would seem anachronistic. \n\n[Root.GetCaptainTitle] [From.GetFormalName] theorises that there may have been a cultural element at play and that, perhaps, the water had some symbolic value beyond its substance."

 STNC_exploration_events.3060.desc.survey_fleet_docks:	"The §Y[FromFrom.GetName]§! has transmitted an update on the progress of its mission to survey in detail the exterior of the §Y[FromFromFrom.GetName]§!. \n\nA series of enormous docking bays have been uncovered, situated close to the access gate. \n\n[Root.GetCaptainTitle] [From.GetFormalName] describes the bays as being large enough to accommodate entire fleets. The docking facilities are equipped with advanced repair and refuelling systems, many of which appear to be in pristine condition despite their age. \n\nThe bays suggest that the §Y[FromFromFrom.GetName]§! was not only a shelter or research station but also served as a hub for a vast network of vessels, possibly for trade, exploration, or even defence. \n\nThe presence of these docking bays raises questions about the sphere's role in the broader galactic community at the time of its construction, deepening the mystery surrounding its origin and history."
 STNC_exploration_events.3060.desc.survey_gravitational_anomaly:	"The §Y[FromFrom.GetName]§! has transmitted an update on the progress of its mission to survey the interior volume of the §Y[FromFromFrom.GetName]§!. \n\n[Root.GetCaptainTitle] [From.GetFormalName] reports encountering a highly localised gravitational anomaly two-hundred thousand kilometres above the Sphere's primary access gate. \n\nThe anomaly appeared to circle above the access gate's perimeter for seven hours before seeming to disappear within the upper subspace layer, speeding and slowing several times. \n\nWhile there is no direct evidence the phenomenon was being directed by an intelligence, the ratio of periods of acceleration and deceleration appears to be connected to the fine structure constant with no obvious mechanism for being so."
 STNC_exploration_events.3060.desc.survey_material_storage:	"[Root.GetCaptainTitle] [From.GetFormalName] reports that the §Y[FromFrom.GetName]§! has discovered a gigantic expanse of material storage depots. As with many aspects of the sphere, the scale of the silos and warehouses defies the common definition of those words, but the purpose of the facilities seems evident. \n\nMany appear to be well-stocked with mundane consumables. Proximity to the entry gate implies that this may be a cargo depot, servicing port facilities closer to the aperture, but the advanced technology of the sphere's creators suggests that they would be beyond the need to ship basic materials in from other locations. \n\n[Root.GetCaptainTitle] [From.GetFormalName] suggests that the opposite could be true, however, with the sphere's host star providing power for industrial replicators of incredible scale, perhaps serving to feed and supply other outposts. \n\nThis remains purely speculative, though, and [Root.GetCaptainTitle] [From.GetFormalName] notes that we should not make assumptions based on our current scientific and cultural understanding, given that the sphere itself defies such notions."
 STNC_exploration_events.3060.desc.survey_port_city:	"The §Y[FromFrom.GetName]§! has transmitted an update on the progress of its mission to survey the interior volume of the §Y[FromFromFrom.GetName]§!. \n\n[Root.GetCaptainTitle] [From.GetFormalName] reports the discovery of an abandoned city on the interior surface near the access hatchway. \n\nDespite being abandoned, the city's parks and various decorative floral arrangements seem to be well kept, though it's unclear how they are being maintained. \n\nThe architecture is plain and devoid of markings or other clues as to the culture of its former inhabitants, though based on the size and arrangement of doors, windows and pathways, it is believed they were humanoid."
 STNC_exploration_events.3060.desc.survey_power_relays:	"The §Y[FromFrom.GetName]§! has encountered what is best described as a city-sized array of power relay nodes in close proximity to the entry gate. \n\nThe function of the relays is clear, and in concept they are not dissimilar to our own, but the scale of the units is immense. The building-sized components must be instrumental in managing the titanic energies required to operate the sphere, but to what end remains a mystery. \n\nIt is possible that the relays regulate and route power to the tractor emitters of the gate itself, but [Root.GetCaptainTitle] [From.GetFormalName] feels the array would be excessive, even for the enormous power requirements of the traffic management beams. Perhaps there is another, as yet unknown, function of the sphere to which the relays are connected. \n\nEither way, [Root.GetCaptainTitle] [From.GetFormalName] believes we can learn much to advance our understanding of macro-scale power systems by studying the array."
 STNC_exploration_events.3060.desc.survey_repair_yard:	"[Root.GetCaptainTitle] [From.GetFormalName] reports an impressive discovery from the sphere. The §Y[FromFrom.GetName]§! has located what appears to be an engineering service yard, equipped to maintain the immense tractor beam units central to the operation of the entry aperture. \n\nThe yard is set several hundred metres into the surface, with gigantic cradles holding tractor beam emitters in various states of assembly. So vast are the emitter units that the facility has more in common with a starship drydock than a machine repair shop. \n\nIt would seem that the sphere's creators deemed it more efficient to periodically swap out the emitters wholesale for maintenance rather than halt traffic through the gate to facilitate repair windows. This suggests that traffic through the gateway was, at one point, at least, regular and essential. \n\n[Root.GetCaptainTitle] [From.GetFormalName] reports that such an opportunity to study the sphere's tractor technology, exposed and easily accessible, might advance our understanding by leaps and bounds."
 STNC_exploration_events.3060.desc.survey_subsurface_tunnels:	"[Root.GetCaptainTitle] [From.GetFormalName] reports that they have begun mapping a vast network of subsurface tunnels in and around the area of the entry gate. \n\nFrom the outset we have speculated that the sphere's shell would host many such service pathways, roughly analogous to the engineering access tubes in our starships, but on a much grander scale. \n\nSome of the tunnels are scarcely large enough for a humanoid to pass through, others are vertical shafts extending into the depths of the sphere's shell, a few are vast caverns. Intriguingly most of the larger passageways are partly obstructed with machinery of unknown purpose, suggesting that, despite the scale, they were never intended to serve as travel routes. \n\nIt is not yet possible to determine the extent of the tunnel network but [Root.GetCaptainTitle] [From.GetFormalName] suspects that the system could be sphere-wide. If this is so, fully mapping the tunnels, even utilising swarms of drones, will be impractical and could take many lifetimes."

 STNC_exploration_events.3070.desc.survey_control_island:	"The §Y[FromFrom.GetName]§! has transmitted an update on the progress of its mission to survey in detail the exterior of the §Y[FromFromFrom.GetName]§!. \n\n[Root.GetCaptainTitle] [Root.GetFormalName] details the discovery of a massive ocean spanning several thousand kilometres across the inner surface of the §Y[FromFromFrom.GetName]§!. \n\nObviously all of the oceans within the sphere are artificial, but this one is particularly noteworthy, described as eerily still with no apparent currents or signs of life. \n\nThe water is perfectly clear, revealing the seabed far below, which is composed of an unknown, highly reflective material. At the centre of the ocean lies a colossal island, which on closer inspection appears to be an enormous control hub for the surrounding area. \n\nThis island is crisscrossed with channels of glowing energy, and towering structures that resemble antennas rise from its surface, stretching hundreds of metres into the air. It is as though the entire region was designed to function as a single massive machine, yet its purpose remains unclear. \n\n[Root.GetCaptainTitle] [From.GetFormalName] has recommended a detailed survey of the island, suspecting that it may hold the key to unlocking other sections of the §Y[FromFromFrom.GetName]§!."
 STNC_exploration_events.3070.desc.survey_energetic_liquid:	"The §Y[FromFrom.GetName]§! has transmitted an update on the progress of its mission to survey in detail the exterior of the §Y[FromFromFrom.GetName]§!. \n\n[Root.GetCaptainTitle] [Root.GetFormalName] notes the detection of a massive underground reservoir beneath the inner surface of the §Y[FromFromFrom.GetName]§!, approximately ten degrees away from the access gate. \n\nThe [Root.GetCaptainTitle] reports that the reservoir is filled with a strange, glowing liquid that appears to be highly energetic. The reservoir is connected to a network of channels that distribute the liquid throughout the region, possibly to power various systems or maintain environmental stability. \n\nThe discovery of this reservoir suggests that the sphere's creators had access to incredibly advanced energy storage and distribution technologies, allowing them to maintain control over the sphere's internal environment with remarkable precision."

The field generated by these towers seems to be maintaining the integrity of the sphere in the area around the entrance portal, counteracting the immense structural strain created by its operation. \n\nThe science behind this generator is far beyond current understanding, but further study will advance our knowledge of structural integrity field technology."

Or, it might simply be decorative.\n\nEmbedded within the structure are vast networks of tunnels and chambers, many of which are filled with ancient machinery and raw materials, possibly designed to maintain its structure over countless millennia."

If we are some day able to establish a permanent presence here, we would stand to gain much from further study of the library."

The walls are lined with complex schematics and prototypes and initial surveys reveal that the facility was once a hub of intense research and experimentation. \n\nThe facility's data logs are heavily encrypted, and many of the experiments remain a mystery. [Root.GetCaptainTitle] [From.GetFormalName] speculates that the builders sought to perfect cloaking technology for both defensive and offensive purposes and the implications of such advancements are significant. \n\nIf the technology found here can be deciphered and adapted, it could revolutionise stealth capabilities for [From.From.GetName], potentially shifting the balance of power across the galaxy."

It may even predate the sphere itself. \n\nThe ship is heavily armoured and equipped with advanced weaponry, suggesting that it was built for war, despite also seemingly also containing expansive housing and habitation facilities, sufficient enough that some have dubbed it a city-ship. \n\nThe fact that it was abandoned within the sphere raises questions about the nature of the relationship between the ship's builders and the sphere's creators. Were they allies? Enemies? Perhaps they were separated by aeons and never even met. \n\nAside from its advanced technology, the city-ship could also hold valuable clues to the history of the sphere and its role in galactic conflicts."

Despite its state, the station still contains valuable technology and data that could provide insight into the history of the sphere and the species that once inhabited it. \n\nHow it came to be within the sphere is a mystery, since it is too large to have been towed through the gateway."

Scans indicate that the climate control systems of the region have been specifically set to create these conditions, though it is possible that they are malfunctioning. \n\nIn any case, the extreme conditions provide a unique opportunity to study the effects of time and the harsh environment on the sphere's infrastructure, as well as the climate control technology utilised by its builders."

The structure, though clearly ancient, is remarkably well-preserved, with its spires and towers stretching high into the artificial sky. \n\nThe [Root.GetCaptainTitle] notes that the architecture is unlike anything encountered before, suggesting the influence of an advanced species, potentially different from the original creators of the sphere. \n\nThe city is devoid of life, its corridors silent, but the technology within is still active, with energy flowing through conduits and data terminals displaying indecipherable symbols. \n\nOne of the most intriguing finds is a central plaza, where a series of monolithic statues stand, each representing a different species. Strangely, the species depicted are recognisable from various parts of the galaxy, though all of them have long been thought extinct. \n\n[Root.GetCaptainTitle] [From.GetFormalName] theorises that this city may have served as a meeting place or refuge for these lost civilisations, preserved within the §Y[FromFromFrom.GetName]§! for reasons that remain unknown."

 STNC_galactic_features.1040.desc:	"Our initial conclusions concerning the ancient D'Arsay civilisation were incorrect: this was not a single a polity. Instead, it seems that over a 100 million years ago, a collection of small kingdoms and villagers slowly adopted a single syncretic pantheon. Local city gods and creation myths were integrated with one another, allowing for a single unifying ethos to emerge. Before their extinction, all D'Arsry polities shared many ideals in arts, philosophy and theology while still keeping their own unique histories, languages, government and currency.\n\nDespite this individuality, two names continue to appear consistently in almost every article we have recovered from the archive: Masaka and Korgano, the prime goddess and god of the D'Arsay pan-global pantheon. It seems those gods held more than a simple symbolic importance, as those names even appeared on government documents. In addition, major market trends and political decisions were assigned, or even seemingly blamed, on one of those two. Exactly why that remains a mystery. More research is required."

The level of complexity and information density the D'Arsay pictographic script offers might explain the overwhelming corrupting elements we encountered when we first activated the Archive.\n\nEach pictograph can correspond to hundreds of different meaning, depending on subtle nuances of syntax, dialect, mode of approach and even the relative social position of the speaker to the potential reader of the text. Wise scholars and lore-masters often not only play tricks with the use of archaic words, but also archaic rules of grammar and reference modes that can lade a simple-looking text with symbolism and portents. We can only imagine the kind of communication devices and self-learning algorithms that were required to make modern-day D'Arsay culture make any sense to itself. What could this civilisation have evolved to if it ever had the chance and managed to discover Warp technology?"

 STNC_galactic_features.1042.desc:	"Our researchers are slowly coming to a startling conclusion concerning the D'Arsay people themselves: they were poikilothermic, meaning their bodies and mental states were highly influenced by fluctuation in temperature. This could explain their obsession with the sun, or why Masaka, their sun goddess, was so highly tied with times of brute actions, sacrifice and war.\n\nWe arrive at this conclusion from a careful study of the D'Arsay holographic records of their former cities. It is clear that heat management was paramount - stone buildings designed to convey heat upwards, large, open, flowing chambers meant to carefully distribute heat and sunlight. The drastic distinction between the airy and cool chambers of Korgano and the suffocating fortresses of Maska also now made sense. The very architecture of the buildings and the way they channelled heat would shape the behaviour of everyone in the building."

Our study of the hull fragments has allowed our scientists to gleam some insight into the vessel's history.\n\nFirstly, based on the relative trajectory and course of the Doomsday Machine, we can presume it came from outside the galaxy.\n\nSecondly, the hull is pure neutronium, a material we have only observed deep within certain stars and the manufacture of which is far beyond our current understanding.\n\nFinally the testing of weapons fire against the neutronium hull chunk has provided us with valuable feedback on how weapons react to nigh invulnerable materials."
 STNC_relics_flavour.200.desc.regular.02:	"Further experimentation upon the Doomsday Fragment has provided deeper insights.

Engineer teams have uncovered some manufacturing defects within the hull fragments, showing that this was created by beings just as fallible as ourselves. Finally the strength of the material is nigh invulnerable to our weapons fire, however it seems that this is the inner hull of the machine - with the outer hull being stripped away millennia in the past. \n\nThese findings are quite unsettling, as it seems larger and more powerful races once existed."

The scoring along the hull fragment suggests numerous sustained battles against anti-proton weaponry. The amount of neutronium within the hull almost guarantees a level of stellar engineering far beyond current technology.\n\nThe Doomsday Machines seem to require a large amount of material to replenish themselves, hence the destruction of entire worlds to power their internal factories. Theoretically the consumption of large vessels should be possible and would be of much more benefit than just raw material. Further research into the fragment will likely provide findings along the same path."

This will also open up a path of research that deals with making materials harder to detect on sensors. The result are ships that are capable of evading enemy fire with much greater ease. I Recommend selecting this option if you want to focus on a fleet of small, fast and nimble ships to maximize this path's benefit.\n\n£ship_stats_armor §GHeavy Hull Construction§!: As the name suggests, by selecting this path we direct our scientists to develop the most durable and resilient substances possible in nature. Eventually, this also leads to breakthroughs in the development of superior armor plating techniques. I recommend this option if you want to focus on fleets of large, sturdy vessels that could benefit from increased armor values.\n\n£ship_stats_hull §GReinforced Hull Construction§!: By selecting this path we direct our scientists to develop the most sturdy hull types available. I recommend this option if you want to focus on fleets of large, sturdy vessels that could benefit from increased hull values.\n\n§GModular Hull Construction§!: By selecting this path we direct our scientists to create a modular hull design where sections can be easily replaced to suit the vessels current mission. Whilst not as strong as other designs, it is the most cost effective way to design a vessel. I recommend this option if you want to focus on fleets of cheaper, more easily replaceable vessels."

We now must make a decision between 2 £science_ship  technological paths.\n\n£ship_stats_speed §GHigh-Energy Impulse Thrusters§!: By selecting this specialisation, we order our scientists to focus their energies to develop thrusters and engines that produce the maximum amount of possible acceleration, at the expense of everything else. The results are some of the fastest ships in the fleet. Your ships could close the distance to the enemy quite quickly. However, they will not be as nimble.\n\n£ship_stats_speed §GLow-Temperature Thrusters§!: Sacrificing speed for the sake of lower emission signature and power consumption, this path of thrusters allow ships a decent speed while being able to evade enemy's sensors. Ships equipped with these engines would be more expensive and slower, but they will enjoy slightly higher evasion chances due to their smaller energy signature."

 story.305.desc.borg:	"The ancient mining drones are indeed primitive, but highly specialised. Mining Network Controller subroutines on [Root.Capital.GetName] indicate efficiencies could be improved by adopting several of their extraction techniques buried in the drone's memory cores; however, this could risk damaging the location data of a number of high-value mining targets nearby. \n\nAdditionally, analysis has indicated that the drones are not completely passive. They emit signal pings, though extremely infrequently and at a wavelength hard to isolate from background noise. There is no indication of what these signals may be targeting."
 story.310.desc.borg:	"The ancient mining drones were destroyed in a heated battle with [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] vessels. Their energy cores are by far the sturdiest component used in their construction, and some were recovered by the Collective. The technology behind these cells is surprisingly advanced and resistant to assimilation, but initial tests show we are quite capable of converting their output to Energy. \n\nAs the final energy cell bled out, our own drones handling the tests noticed a dip in background radiation. It would appear that the ancient mining drones are not silent, but they have been sporadically broadcasting on unusual frequencies since we first encountered them, possibly ever since they were first deployed. It is unlikely that there is anyone left to receive these transmissions.\n\nThe drones could prove to be a potent but limited source of energy, should we be able to find and disable them efficiently enough."

[Root.GetAdj] scientists have recommended a combination of active and passive study. \n\n[Root.GetCaptainTitle] [From.GetFormalName] proposes to tag several Buhgoon with harmless radioisotope trackers and release them back into the herd - this will give our xenobiologists valuable data on the activities of the Buhgoon in the wild. Additionally, a team of specialists is prepared to attempt to capture a live specimen to be returned to §Y[Root.Capital.GetName]§! for study."
